Notes on specific options:

`fr-config-pull journeys`

The `--name` option can be used with the `journeys` command to pull a specific journey. This can only be used if a single realm is requested, either via the .env/environment setting or via the `--realm` option. For example

```
fr-config-pull journeys --name "Customer Login" --realm alpha
```

The `--pull-dependencies` option can be used with the `journeys` command to pull all scripts and inner journeys associated with each journey pulled. For example

```
fr-config-pull journeys --name "Customer Login" --realm alpha --pull-dependencies
```

`fr-config-pull csp`

The CSP configuration endpoint requires an access token with the scope `fr:idc:content-security-policy:*`,
which is not permitted for Identity Cloud service accounts as of this version of `fr-config-manager`.

Therefore, for managing CSP configuration specifically, you need to set the environment variable
`TENANT_ACCESS_TOKEN` with an access token with this scope - for example from the admin UI. Therefore
the `csp` command is not included by default for `fr-config-pull all`.

`fr-config-pull org-privileges`

The `--name` option can be used with the `org-privileges` command to pull a specific config: the valid config names are

- `alphaOrgPrivileges`
- `bravoOrgPrivileges`
- `privilegeAssignments`

`fr-config-pull raw`

The `--path` option can be used with the `raw` command to pull a specific configuration path. e.g.

```
fr-config-pull raw --path /openidm/config/authentication
```

The `--push-api-version` option is used in conjunction with the `--path` option to specify the protocol and resource versions to use for any subsequent push operations on this resource. This information is stored within the pulled config for consumption by the `fr-config-push raw` command. E.g.

```
fr-config-pull raw --path /am/json/realms/root/realms/alpha/realm-config/webhooks/test-webhook --push-api-version.protocol 2.0 --push-api-version.resource 1.0
```

If the `--path` option is not provided, then the tool pulls all config referenced in the file pointed to by the `RAW_CONFIG` environment setting.

`fr-config-pull iga-workflows`

The `--name` option may be used to specify a specific workflow by its name.

If the `--include-immutable` option is provided, then both mutable and immutable workflows are pulled. Note that immutable workflows will be skipped when performing a `fr-config-push iga-workflows`.

`fr-config-pull custom-nodes`

The `--name` option may be used to specify a specific custom node by its name.

The `--contract-require` will restore require statements which were expanded by the `fr-config-push custom-nodes --expand-require` command. Refer to the [custom nodes README](../../docs/custom-nodes.md) for details.
