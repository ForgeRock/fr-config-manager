# Exported configuration structure

These tools create or expect a configuration repository with the structure below. Configuration consists of

- Realm specific configuration under the `realms` top level directory

- Global configuration under its respective top level directories

### Realm specific configuration

The configuration repo contains the top level directory `realms` with a subdirectory for each of the realms to be pushed/pulled - `alpha` and/or `bravo`. Each realm directory has the following subdirectories:

| Directory              | Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| esvs                    | Subdirectories as follows<ul><li>`secrets`- one JSON file`{secret-name}.json` per environment secret<li>`variables`- one JSON file`{variable-name}.json`per environment variable</ul>Each JSON file has a placeholder for the`valueBase64` value. This is intended for substitution with an environment variable in the working environment of the configuration push. In the case of secrets, there are one or more versions of the secret listed in the JSON file.
